0.3.0

* The mod is ported to teeworlds-0.7.0.1

* [gameplay change] When sv_fb_laser_momentum is set to nonzero value and a
ball is shot at, it no longer changes the team it belongs to.  Previously a
defender could shoot the ball to `own' it and, depending on sv_fb_owngoal
value, either avoid the goal or risk making an own goal. Now the ball always
belongs to the team that last touched it.

* [gameplay change] The ball no longer changes colors (swaps with the inactive
flag). This ability was lost during the porting, but might be restored in the
future.

* [enhancement] New configuration variable: sv_fb_ball_friction.

* [deprecation] Configuration variables sv_fb_ball_offset_x and
sv_fb_ball_offset_y were deprecated. The ball hookable center is fixed at (0,
38) which corresponds to the visible center of the flag image.

* [deprecation] Configuration variable sv_fb_welcome_message was deprecated.
